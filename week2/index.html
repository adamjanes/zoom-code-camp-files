    <h2>Studying Advice</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</p>
  <p>Always study in the same place?</p>
  <p class="wrong-text">Wrong!</p>
  <p>Study one topic intensively before going on to the next?</p>
  <p class="wrong-text">Wrong!</p>
  <p>Here are some study tips based on <strong>actual research.</strong></p>
  <p id="cite-text">From <em>Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits</em>, by Benedict Carey, publishd in the <em>New York Times</em> on September 6, 2010.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">Alternate study environments</h3>
  <p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ... Varying the place you study helps you remember more.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">Mix content</h3>
  <p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some of this again, some of the other. Switching content help you remember more.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">Space study sessions</h3>
  <p>Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">Self-testing</h3>
  <p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you to know how well you know.</p>
